# Advanced STL: Stack, Queue, Linked List

## Stacks

A stack is a linear data structure, collection of items of the same type. Stack follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) fashion wherein the last element entered is the first one to be popped out.

## Queues

A Queue is a linear structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order is First In First Out (FIFO) and has a wide variety of applications. A queue is a data structure whose primary purpose is to store and maintain a list of elements in a linear fashion, first in first out order.

## Linked Lists

Linked lists are one of the most fundamental data structure. A linked list is a linear data structure that includes a series of connected nodes. Here, each node stores the data and the address of the next node. The first node is called head and the last node is called tail.
