# Trees

A tree is non-linear and a hierarchical data structure consisting of a collection of nodes such that each node of the tree stores a value, a list of references to nodes (the “children”).

## Binary trees

A binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children. The left child is always less than the parent and the right child is always greater than the parent.

## Binary Search Tree (BST)

A binary search tree (BST) is a node-based binary tree data structure which has the following properties:
* The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
* The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
* The left and right subtrees are also binary search trees.
* There must be no duplicate nodes.
