# Week 0 Topic 1/3: Gearing Up

Before you jump into competitive programming, there are a few things you might want to look at:

## Setting up an IDE

You could use a text editor of your choice, such as Vim or VS Code or Sublime Text.

**VS Code** is our personal text editor of choice due to it's features, minimalist design and wide range of extension support.

You may also choose to look at the following:

## Choosing a Language

**C++** and **Java** are the most commonly used languages due to their 'speed' of execution, which is an important factor in competitive programming.

Here's a short overview on both sides of the debate:

1. **Speed**: C++ is certainly faster than Java but the difference isn't large enough to cause substantial issues unless the time constraints are really tight.
2. **Functionalities**: Java provides certain in-built capabilities through which we can avoid writing complex code (for example - BigInteger Class). However, C++ posesses the superior Standard Template Library (STL) that allows you to easily implement simple and complex Data Structures and Algorithms.
3. **Verbosity**: Java is more verbose and so it might take more time writing in Java code for simple programs.

## C++ Standard Template Library (STL)

The C++ STL is a huge library of useful functions and it is almost imperative for every C++ competitive programmer to be familiar with the STL.
