# Two Pointer + Sliding Window

Two Pointers is a technique in which two pointers iterate across the data structure until one or both of them satisfy the necessary condition.

In the sliding window technique, we maintain a window that satisfies the problem constraints. The window is unstable if it violates the problem constraints, and it tries to stabilize by increasing or decreasing its size.
