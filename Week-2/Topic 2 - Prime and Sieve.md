# Prime Factorisation and Sieve

The prime factorization of a number can be easily calculated in O(sqrt(n)) time.

You can very efficiently calculate all the prime factors less than or equal to a number N with the time complexity O(N log(log(N))) by the algorithm Sieve of Eratosthenes.
You can refer to the following resources.

There is another way to calculate the prime factors of a number in O(log(N)) time.
